Instructions:

- open Sample.sln with Visual Studio (2017 is recommended)

- inside the Program class you will find some functions partially filled in with code

- each function is commented to explain what it does. In the comments you can also read the number of the exercise (there are 5 exercises in total).

- click on "View" -> "Task List" and a list of TO DO items will open in the bottom part of the IDE

- double clicking on each TO DO item (for example, "TODO: Ex 1.1") will bring you to the part of code that you have to complete. To get a 10 you must correctly fill in all TO DO items.

- to execute the program, press Ctrl+F5 and the console will open, showing your result: you can see for each exercise if it correct or not, and the amount of points that each exercise gives you. The last row shows the current grade you would get. When you start up the solution for the first time, every exercise is marked as wrong, and the grade is 1.

- The 5 exercises give the following amount of points:
	- exercise 1: 1 point
	- exercise 2: 1 point
	- exercise 3: 2 points
	- exercise 4: 2 points
	- exercise 5: 3 points
The grade is computed as 1 + the sum of points of each exercise. For each exercise you can only get 0 or the full amount of points associated to it (no intermediate values are possible).

- if your code throws an exception, the console will display the message of the exception and nothing else. You will not receive a grade in this case.
